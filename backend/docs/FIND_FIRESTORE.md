# How to Find Firestore Database in Firebase Console

## After Creating a Project

After you click "Create project" and "Continue", you might see:

### Screen You Should See:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Project Name] - Firebase Console │
│                                     │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Welcome to Firebase          │ │
│  │ Get started by...            │ │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                     │
│  Left Sidebar:                      │
│  ├── Overview                      │
│  ├── Build                         │
│  ├── 🔥 Firestore Database        │  ← Look here!
│  ├── Storage                       │
│  ├── Authentication                │
│  └── ...                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## If You Don't See the Sidebar

### Step 1: Look for a Menu Icon (☰ or ≡)
- Top-left corner might have a hamburger menu icon
- Click it to expand the sidebar

### Step 2: Look for Project Name at Top
- Top of page shows your project name
- Click it if it's a dropdown
- This might open navigation menu

### Step 3: Check Left Edge of Screen
- Sidebar might be collapsed (just showing icons)
- Hover over left edge or click to expand
- Look for icons:
  - 🔥 (Fire) = Firestore
  - 📦 (Box) = Storage
  - 🔐 (Lock) = Authentication

### Step 4: Search for "Firestore"
- Use browser search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F)
- Search for "Firestore"
- This will highlight it on the page

### Step 5: Direct URL
Try going directly to:
- https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/firestore

Replace YOUR-PROJECT-ID with your project ID.

## Alternative: Use Project Settings

1. Look for gear icon (⚙️) or "Settings"
2. Click "Project settings"
3. In left sidebar, you should see:
   - General
   - Firestore Database
   - Storage
   - Authentication

## Still Can't Find It?

### Try This:
1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. **Check if project is still creating** (wait 30 seconds)
3. **Look for a "Database" menu item** (Firebase might have renamed it)
4. **Try the Firebase Console menu** (three lines ☰ icon)

## What to Tell Me:
If you still can't find it, tell me:
1. What you see at the top of the page (project name?)
2. Do you see any sidebar at all?
3. Do you see any menu icons (☰)?
4. What buttons/links are visible?
